                    But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Damage report! Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. This should be interesting. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Sorry, Data. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. They were just sucked into space. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself.
