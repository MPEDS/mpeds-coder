Seventy-eight members of the House of Representatives have urged President Reagan to rehire some of the air traffic controllers who were dismissed four years ago, saying the current controller work force ''is stretched beyond its human capacity.''

Representatives Guy V. Molinari, Republican of Staten Island, who drafted a letter sent to the President Thursday, said a decision by the Administration to train 1,000 new controllers over the next two years would not solve the problem because it would take years for those trainees to become qualified. ''There is no other source where you can buy the experience that we need now other than the controllers released in 1981,'' Mr. Molinari said at a news conference.

The Administration has said it has no intention of rehiring any of the 11,400 controllers dismissed in August 1981 after they staged an illegal strike.

In a letter to Mr. Molinari two weeks ago, Donald D. Engen, Administrator of the aviation agency, rejected the possibility of any such rehirings and said of the air traffic system, ''It is working well.''

He said that to rehire the controllers would amount to ''breaking the faith'' with controllers and supervisors who stayed on the job. He also said the former controllers ''would require stringent and extensive recertification training.''

Mr. Molinari said White House officials had told him they intended to ask Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole to present a report on the air traffic control system and that he planned to discuss the matter with her next week.
