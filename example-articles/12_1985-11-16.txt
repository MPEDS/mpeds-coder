The Economy

Industrial production was unchanged in October, disappointing analysts who had expected a modest advance. Output was crimped by strikes at Chrysler and at some military equipment facilities. [Page 35.] Producer prices soared by 0.9 percent in October, the biggest rise since 1981, lifted by food and new-car costs. But some analysts saw the month as an aberration that did not hurt the outlook for continued low inflation. [36.] Business sales fell 0.5 percent in September, while inventories climbed 0.2 percent. The inventory-to-sales ratio rose to 1.35 from 1.34 in August. [36.]

Tax credits for rehabilitating old buildings would be limited, but not abolished, under a decision made by the House Ways and Means Committee. The panel also approved changes in the tax treatment of insurance companies and of homeowners who install energy-saving devices. [38.] The committee has repeatedly shown a soft spot for small business. [35.]

Companies

A big mortgage banker suddenly went out of business, apparently because of financial problems. E.F. Hutton, which had bought millions of dollars of mortgages from the mortgage banker, the First American Mortgage Company of Baltimore, filed suit. Details of First American's operations were sketchy, but sources familiar with them said First American was a leading originator of loans on already mortgaged residences. [35.]

Bally is in talks to acquire MGM Grand Hotels, sources familiar with the negotiations said. They estimated the price at $400 million. Kirk Kerkorian owns 70 percent of MGM Grand and has offered to buy the rest. But by selling, he could reap $280 million to help run United Artists. [35.] Atlantis Casino Hotel in Atlantic City filed for bankruptcy protection. [30.]

Prudential will increase Prudential-Bache's reported capital by $600 million, more than doubling the brokerage firm's capital. It plans to do so by converting short-term loans to Prudential-Bache into floating-rate preferred stock. The firm could use the larger pool of capital to try to win more business. [37.]

NBC plans to move from its Rockefeller Center headquarters, a site it has occupied for more than a half century, company and city officials said. The network is looking at sites in Manhattan and New Jersey in its search for more space and more-modern studios, they said. The network's current leases at Rockefeller Center begin to expire in 1989 and end entirely in 1997. [1.]

Beecham Group of Britain is in talks with Pantry Pride about acquiring Revlon's Norcliff Thayer unit, which makes health aids and over-the-counter medications. Revlon had planned to sell the unit to American Home Products. [36.]

Markets

Prices of Treasury securities rebounded despite tight credit conditions resulting from heavy Government borrowings. With the Treasury about to auction $22 billion of cash-management bills later in the day, the Federal Reserve took the uncommon pre-sale action of announcing that it would ease credit. [38.]

Stock prices fell moderately on profit taking. Trading was erratic, reflecting the expiration of stock index futures and options. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.13 points, to 1,435.09, but it gained 30.73 points for the week. Volume for the day rose to 130.2 million shares. Auto companies were up sharply. [39.]

The dollar moved slightly higher in light trading. Gold fell $1, to $323.75. [44.] Soybean futures prices fell sharply. [44.] International

Tax cuts to spur growth should be adopted by key countries to prevent economic ''stagnation,'' a committee of the O.E.C.D. said. The appeal for ''supply-oriented tax cuts'' was aimed mainly at Britain, West Germany and Japan, officials said, although no countries were named in the statement. [36.]

Today's Columns
